# Frayt Web App
This is the front end app for the web version of the Shipper experience in Frayt. This version is compatible with the new back end being developed in Elixir and Phoenix. You'll need that project cloned and set up as well.
 
## Getting started
1. Get the `.env.development.local` from another developer
2. Do `export FRAYT_FONT_AWESOME_TOKEN=<value from .env.development.local>`
3. `npm install`
4. Start the elixir back end app
5. `npm run dev`
6. Profit!
